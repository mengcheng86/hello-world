learn Git
Since 2012.4, I started my program with no teachers and no Internet. At the beginning, my program was on LabView. Because of the large package, I ran out LabView and chose Visual Studio 2005 with MFC. And MFC just lasted two years, then C# fascinated me with its pithility and other excellent performance. In my work, most of the program is small-sized (scaled in 1000~5000). No need of Github, no need of frame and some rule. Therefore, I have no idea with the popular word like "Github", "Frame", "database", and so on. With the programming, I felt the poor aware of programming, and want to learn more about program. I want to make something out of work, just because I want to do it.
Github is my first change.
